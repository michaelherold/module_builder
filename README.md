TODO: Describe the gem.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'module_builder'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install module_builder

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

When writing code, you can use the helper application [Guard][guard] to
automatically run tests and coverage tools whenever you modify and save a file.
This helps to eliminate the tedium of running tests manually and reduces the
change that you will accidentally forget to run the tests. To use Guard, run
`bundle exec guard`.

Before committing code, run `rake` to check that the code conforms to the style
guidelines of the project, that all of the tests are green (if you're writing a
feature; if you're only submitting a failing test, then it does not have to
pass!), and that the changes are sufficiently documented.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org][rubygems].
